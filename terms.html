RizzUp Privacy Policy

Last Updated: May 14, 2025

RizzUp (“I,” “me,” or “my”) is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using my mobile application (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains what information I collect, how I use it, how I store and protect it, and your rights under applicable data-protection laws (including, where applicable, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar frameworks).

⸻

1. Scope & Definitions
	•	User Data: Any information you provide or that is generated by your use of the App (including screenshots, derivative AI outputs, and metadata).
	•	Personal Data: Information that can identify you directly or indirectly (e.g., email address, device identifiers).
	•	Processing: Any operation performed on data (collection, storage, use, disclosure, deletion).

This policy applies to all Users of the RizzUp mobile App, regardless of location.

2. Data I Collect

2.1 Data You Provide
	•	Chat Screenshots & Text Inputs
	•	You may upload screenshots of conversations or type text manually for AI processing.
	•	These inputs become part of the processing pipeline to generate suggested replies or conversation-starters.
	•	Account & Device Information
	•	If you choose to provide an email address (for support or referral), that is stored.
	•	I collect an anonymized device identifier (e.g. Apple’s appUserID) to manage subscriptions and prevent duplicate trial usage.

2.2 Automatically Collected Data
	•	Usage Metrics
	•	Counts of features used (screenshots, manual entries, conversation-starters per day) to enforce free vs. premium quotas.
	•	Crash Reports & Performance Logs
	•	Error logs, crash dumps, and performance analytics may be collected (via third-party SDKs) to improve stability.

⸻

3. How I Process Your Data
	1.	Local Pre-Processing
	•	Screenshots are first processed locally on your device (OCR or image analysis) to extract text, ensuring raw images never leave your device until you expressly request AI assistance.
	2.	AI Processing
	•	Extracted text is sent to Our’s API (or similar AI provider) for generating conversation replies.
	•	Only the text content you provided is transmitted—no other personal identifiers accompany it.
	3.	Data Storage for Development
	•	With your consent, anonymized inputs and outputs may be stored in encrypted form on secure servers for model improvement, debugging, and feature development.
	•	Any stored data is stripped of personal identifiers and used only in aggregate or for retraining.

⸻

4. Purpose & Legal Basis
	•	Performance of a Contract
	•	Processing your screenshot/text inputs and returning AI suggestions is necessary to provide the core App features under your subscription or free-tier usage.
	•	Legitimate Interests
	•	Improving App performance, fixing bugs, and enhancing AI accuracy through anonymized logs and aggregated analytics.
	•	Enforcing daily usage limits and preventing fraud (e.g., multi-account trial abuse).
	•	Consent
	•	Where required by law (e.g., optional crash reporting), you will be asked to opt in explicitly.

⸻

5. Data Retention
	•	Active Usage Data (feature counts, app settings) is stored until you uninstall the App or reset counters.
	•	Anonymized Development Logs are retained for up to 12 months and then purged, unless you request earlier deletion.
	•	Crash Reports are retained per the configurations of integrated SDKs but no longer than needed for debugging (maximum 90 days).

⸻

6. Data Security

I implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, including but not limited to:
	•	Encryption in Transit (TLS 1.2+) for all network communications.
	•	Secure Storage using iOS’s Keychain or encrypted local databases.
	•	Least-Privilege Access for any server-side logs or analytics, with all data pseudonymized.
	•	Regular Security Audits and penetration testing of backend systems.

⸻

7. Third-Party Services
	•	OpenAI (or equivalent AI API) processes your text inputs. Subject to their privacy policy; no personal identifiers are shared.
	•	RevenueCat SDK manages subscriptions and entitlements; governed by RevenueCat’s privacy compliance.
	•	Apple In-App Purchases systems handle payment data and do not share your financial details with me.

⸻

8. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:
	•	Access: Request a copy of Personal Data I hold about you.
	•	Rectification: Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
	•	Erasure (“Right to be Forgotten”): Delete your Personal Data or stored logs.
	•	Restriction: Limit how I process your data.
	•	Portability: Obtain your data in a machine-readable format.
	•	Object: Withdraw consent or object to certain processing (e.g., analytics).

To exercise these rights, contact me at privacy@rizzup.com. I will respond within one month (or faster, where required by law).

9. Children’s Privacy

I do not knowingly collect or solicit data from anyone under 18. If you believe I have inadvertently collected such data, please contact privacy@rizzup.com so I can delete it promptly.

⸻

10. International Data Transfers

If you are located outside my home country, note that data (even anonymized) may be processed or stored in servers located in another jurisdiction. I ensure adequate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) are in place.

11. Changes to This Policy

I may update this Policy from time to time. The “Last Updated” date at the top reflects the current version. Significant changes will be highlighted in-app or via email if you have opted in.
