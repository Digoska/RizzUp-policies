RizzUp Terms of Service

Last updated: May 14, 2025

1. Acceptance of Terms
By downloading, installing, or using RizzUp (the “App”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, please uninstall the App and discontinue use.

2. About Me
I develop and maintain RizzUp as an independent app. References to “I,” “me,” or “my” mean the app’s sole developer.

3. Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years old to use the App. By using the App, you represent that you meet this requirement.

4. License to Use the App
I grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App on any Apple-branded devices that you own or control, subject to these Terms.

5. Subscriptions, Free Trial & Billing
	•	Free Tier: You get up to 3 screenshots, 5 manual entries, and 5 conversation-starters per 24-hour period at no cost.
	•	Premium Subscription: Unlock up to 50 of each per day. Offered as a weekly auto-renewing subscription at €4.99, including a 3-day free trial.
	•	Billing: All charges are processed through Apple’s In-App Purchase system using your Apple ID. Payment is due immediately upon trial expiration or purchase confirmation.
	•	Cancellation: You may cancel anytime via your Apple ID subscription settings. Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period; no refunds for partial periods.

6. Account & Device Data
I collect minimal data necessary for feature enforcement (e.g. feature-use counters, anonymized AppUserID). You are responsible for keeping any account credentials secure.

7. User Content & Conduct
	•	You may only upload screenshots or text you own or have permission to use.
	•	You must not use the App to create or disseminate illegal, harassing, hateful, or sexually explicit content.
	•	I reserve the right to suspend or terminate access for any user who violates these rules.

8. Intellectual Property
All App code, designs, graphics, and trademarks are owned by me. You may not reverse-engineer, copy, or create derivative works.

9. Privacy & Data Processing
My Privacy Policy (linked separately) explains what data I collect, how I use it, and your rights. In brief:
	•	Local OCR/Text Processing: Your screenshots are first processed on-device.
	•	AI Processing: Extracted text is sent to OpenAI for generating replies; no personal identifiers are shared.
	•	Development Logs: With consent, anonymized inputs/outputs may be stored up to 12 months for improving the service.

10. Disclaimers & Liability
	•	The App is provided “as-is,” without warranties of any kind.
	•	I am not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of the App.

11. Changes to Terms
I may revise these Terms at any time. I’ll notify you in-app or via email of significant changes. Continued use after updates indicates acceptance.

12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Country/State]. Any disputes will be resolved in the appropriate courts located there.
